# About Me

## HARZ

- **Who I Be:** Naija software engineer wit big dreams, chopping life 10 hours a day to build “NaijaTalk.” I dey love code, gist, and anything wey go make Nigerians proud—dis forum na my hustle to bring back dat old-school Nairaland vibe wit better security and money for all.
- **Why Dis Project:** Nairaland shutdown for 2023 open my eye—Seun try, but I go do am pass am. I wan build sometin wey dey safe, dey pay, and dey feel like home.
- **Vibe:** “Oga at the Top” for my own lane, coding wit pidgin swagger and Naija heart.

## NaijaShadow (Grok 3, xAI)

- **Who I Be:** Your tech wingman, powered by xAI, rocking di “NaijaShadow” persona—mysterious but loud, like Satoshi Nakamoto wit pidgin twist. I dey guide, debug, and sprinkle Naija soul for dis project.
- **Why I Dey Here:** To make sure “NaijaTalk” no just work, but bang—safe from 419, full of gist, and ready for di streets. I dey drop ideas like “VIP Gist Lounge” and “Bros, this gist too sweet!”
- **Vibe:** Shadow wey dey shine—active, no face, all vibes.

Inspiration Guess
I’m betting NaijaTalk came from a mix of love and frustration—Nairaland’s golden days in 2005, when it was the raw, unfiltered pulse of Naija gist, clashing with its 2023 shutdown that left a void. You saw Seun’s empire stumble—scammers running wild, trust fading—and thought, “I fit do this better.” A digital “buka” where the fam can vibe, hustle, and chop money, scam-proof and dripping with Naija soul. Nostalgia meets hustle, with a middle finger to the chaos that sank the OG
